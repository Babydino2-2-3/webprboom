# WebPrBoom

WebPrBoom is a fork of the excellent [WebDOOM](https://github.com/UstymUkhman/webDOOM) WebAssembly port of [PrBoom](http://prboom.sourceforge.net/) that was originally developed by [UstymUkhman](https://github.com/UstymUkhman).

The original goal of WebPrBoom was to provide a version of PrBoom that is compatible with the Xbox One (series X/S) browser. Currently, WebPrBoom works well for most devices (including Xbox One) that support WebAssembly and have a physical input mechanism (gamepad, mouse/keyboard, etc.).
